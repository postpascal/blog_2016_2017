### Before Machine Learning 

```
Do machine learning like the great engineer you are, not like the expert you aren't.
```

> Machine learning is all of Engineering. Solve problems with engineering tools not just machine learning. ML is limited, but engineering is not. Engineering's destiny is to quantify problems then solve it. In this case, the first target is how to quantify problems --- Design metrics.

Rule #1: Donâ€™t be afraid to launch a product without machine learning.

Rule #2: Make metrics design and implementation a priority.
Rule #3: Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic.
### ML Phase I: Your First Pipeline
Rule #4: Keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right. 

```  python
def  test():
	print(dsd)
```
